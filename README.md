# MyReads Project

# Objective
This is a project of the Advanced Front-End development program by Udacity.

# About
MyReads app is used to manage your reads by allocating the books on three shelves (current reading, want to read, and read). The app uses a backend server that provides the books and their related data [Title, images, authors]. The user uses the book data received from the backend and allocates them to the desired shelf. There is a search part that picks up more books on the user shelf. The app components are all synchronized that at any part show the same data.


# Install
install all project dependencies with `npm install`.

# Use
start the development server with `npm start`.
